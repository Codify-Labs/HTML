IDEAS FROM ME
I.
“Not being busy is a competitive advantage. Most people are so strapped for time they can't take advantage of lucky opportunities or quickly resolve unexpected problems. Maintain a bias toward action, but leave room for the unexpected.”

II.
“Finishing projects is part of what it means to deliver high quality work. It's not high quality if your perfectionism prevents you from finishing.”
