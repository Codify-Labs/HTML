Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.

Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
